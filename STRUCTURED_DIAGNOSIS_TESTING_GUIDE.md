# üß™ Structured Diagnosis Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the structured diagnosis endpoints of your Tenderly AI Agent.

## üéØ Available Endpoints

### 1. Test Endpoint (No Authentication)
- **URL**: `POST /api/v1/diagnosis/structured/test`
- **Authentication**: Not required
- **Purpose**: Testing and development

### 2. Production Endpoint (Authentication Required)

#### Authenticated Endpoint
1. First generate a token:
```bash
python generate_token.py
```

2. Then use the token in your request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/diagnosis/structured \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{ ... same JSON as above ... }'
```

## üìä Key Features Tested

### ‚úÖ What the Structured Diagnosis Provides:

1. **Comprehensive Assessment**:
   - Multiple possible diagnoses with confidence scores
   - Clinical reasoning and differential considerations
   - Risk assessment with urgency levels

2. **Safety Features**:
   - Drug allergy considerations
   - Safe medication alternatives
   - Contraindicated medications
   - Medical condition interactions

3. **Clinical Guidance**:
   - Recommended investigations with priorities
   - Treatment recommendations with safe alternatives
   - Lifestyle and dietary advice
   - Follow-up timelines

4. **Patient Education**:
   - Educational content
   - Warning signs to monitor
   - When to seek emergency care

## üõ†Ô∏è Validation Tests

The structured endpoint validates:
- **Patient age**: Must be 12-100 years
- **Timestamp format**: Must be valid ISO format
- **Request ID**: Must be at least 3 characters
- **Symptom-specific details**: Required based on main symptom
- **Drug allergy conflicts**: Checks for medication-allergy conflicts

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **422 Validation Error**:
   - Check required fields are present
   - Verify timestamp is in ISO format
   - Ensure symptom-specific details match main symptom

2. **401 Authentication Error**:
   - Generate a fresh token using `python generate_token.py`
   - Ensure token is included in Authorization header

3. **500 Internal Server Error**:
   - Check server logs for detailed error information
   - Verify all required model fields are properly structured

## üìù Usage Notes

- The test endpoint (`/structured/test`) is perfect for development and testing
- The production endpoint (`/structured`) requires authentication for security
- All responses include comprehensive safety assessments
- Drug allergies are carefully considered in treatment recommendations
- Urgency levels help prioritize patient care

## üéØ Integration Tips

When integrating with your NestJS backend:
1. Use the authenticated endpoint for production
2. Implement proper error handling for validation failures
3. Store and display safety warnings prominently
4. Consider urgency levels for patient triage
5. Present medication alternatives clearly when allergies are present
